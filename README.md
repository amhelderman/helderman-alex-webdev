# Who is Alex Helderman?

I am a part-time graduate student at Northeastern University, but I also work as a software engineer nearby.

In my undergraduate studies, my projects included building a processor on an FPGA (in a few ways), prototyping assistive embedded devices for the Deaf, studying how to best create an interactive exhibit to educate the public about right whales.

My experiences in the workplace have taught me a lot about how to best develop software for a variety of uses. As for web-related work, I've worked with some legacy server-side programs, but also fine-tuning the UI.
